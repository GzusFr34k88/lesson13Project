### How To Play:
To play the game, use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the character. If you are playing on a touch screen device, you can also swipe to move. Avoid hitting the bugs and don't touch the water. Hitting a bug or touching the water will make you lose a life (Sorry, you can't swim). You will start out with 5 lives. Each time you lose a life, you will lose 100 points. The yellow/orange gem is worth 100 points, the green gem is worth 75 points, and the blue gem is worth 25 points. The goal of the game is to get the highest scoe you can. At the end of the game, you should play again and try to beat your previous score. My highest so far is 2500 points. Try to beat me (Shouldn't be to hard). HAVE FUN!
